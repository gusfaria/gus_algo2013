I don't really know what I'm going to do, but since I'm using face recognition for my thesis I will be probably using that to make an interactive piece.
I really like this work by Jono Brandel: http://works.jonobr1.com/Neuronal-Synchrony
And anther reference is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0USJPWX8sQ



MAYBE GENERATE AN ART PIECE FOR EVERYONE THAT LOOKS AT THE ARTWORK! 
CW: make it look goodâ€¦ make people want to eat the things.
	polish the mechanics and the algo in it

GAME: FASTFOOD 
Use facetracker.
have the character to eat burgers hot dogs and pizza.
when there is food the person can't eat the screen starts shaking
the more you eat, the slower you get! 

the faster you eat the better you will be in the rank
