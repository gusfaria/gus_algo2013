I don't really know what I'm going to do, but since I'm using face recognition for my thesis I will be probably using that to make an interactive piece.
I really like this work by Jono Brandel: http://works.jonobr1.com/Neuronal-Synchrony
And anther reference is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0USJPWX8sQ



MAYBE GENERATE AN ART PIECE FOR EVERYONE THAT LOOKS AT THE ARTWORK!
